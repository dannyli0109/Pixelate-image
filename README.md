## Pixelate an image using p5.js

### steps: 

- Given a picture with 600 * 400 pixels
- In order to get the pixelated version of the image we need to shrink the image 10 times
- We now get an image of 60 * 40 pixels
- We look up each of the pixels of the shrinked image and draw a squre of 10 * 10 pixels and fill the color with shrinked image
- Do it for every pixel and we can get the pixelated version of the image
